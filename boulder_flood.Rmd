# 2013 Boulder Flood Analysis

## Project Goals:

* Examine landscape changes following flood disturbance to the Boulder, CO area using NEON remote sensing products
* Identify areas of greater vegetation disturbance using LiDAR derived digital surface models (DSM)
* Identify areas of erosion and deposition using digital terrain models (DTM)

```{r import-rasters, echo = FALSE}
# importing pre and post flood  digital surface rasters
pre.dsm <- raster("../NEONdata/Boulder_Flood/BLDR_LeeHill_Pre_Post_Flood/pre-flood/BLDR_pre_DSM/preDSM3.tif")

post.dsm <- raster("../NEONdata/Boulder_Flood/BLDR_LeeHill_Pre_Post_Flood/post-flood/postDSM/postDSM3.tif")

# importing pre and post flood digital terrain models

pre.dtm <- raster("../NEONdata/Boulder_Flood/BLDR_LeeHill_Pre_Post_Flood/pre-flood/BLDR_pre_DTM/preDTM3.tif")

post.dtm <- raster("../NEONdata/Boulder_Flood/BLDR_LeeHill_Pre_Post_Flood/post-flood/postDTM/postDTM3.tif")

```

## Vegetation loss from flooding

Using the DSM we can calculate a change in vegetation cover.
```{r get-simple-CHM}
# We want to make simple Canopy Height Models of pre- and post-flooding
post_chm <- post.dsm - post.dtm
# 0 values as NA
post_chm[post_chm == 0] <- NA

pre_chm <- pre.dsm - pre.dtm
# 0 values as NA
pre_chm[pre_chm == 0] <- NA

```

```{r check-pre-post-veg-diff}
# Subtract post- from pre-flooding to evaluate veg loss
chm_diff <- post_chm - pre_chm

chm_diff[chm_diff < 1 & chm_diff > -1] <- NA
# Lots of noise. About a half meter of error.
#chm_diff[chm_diff < 1 & chm_diff > -1] <- NA

```

Plotting the vegetation cover change
```{r plot-diff}
density(chm_diff)

# Hard-coded breaks and colors
breaks <- seq(-25, 25, 5)
plotCols <- c(rev(rainbow(5, start = 0, end = .1)), rainbow(5, v = .6, start = .7, end = .8))
plot(chm_diff,
     breaks = breaks,
     col = plotCols,
     main = "Vegetation Change Post-Flood")

```

```{r dtm-change}
# DTM layer change calculation
dtm.change <- pre.dtm - post.dtm
dtm.change[ dtm.change == 0] <- NA
dtm.change[dtm.change < 1 & dtm.change > -1] <- NA

# density plot of elevation change
density_plot_from_dtm(dtm.change, "Elevation Change Post-Flood \nBoulder, CO")

plot(pre.dtm,
     col = topo.colors(255),
     main = "Pre-Flood DTM \nBoulder, CO")

dtm.breaks <- seq(-50, 50, 10)
plotColsdtm <- c(rev(rainbow(5, start = 0, end = .1)), rainbow(5, v = .6, start = .7, end = .8))
# combo plot
plot(dtm.change,
     breaks = dtm.breaks,
     col = plotColsdtm,
      main =  "Erosion and Deposition Post-Flood")
# # Erosion!
# plot(dtm.change, 
#      zlim = c(-50,0),
#           col = heat.colors(5),
#      main = "Erosion Post-Flood \nBoulder, CO")
# 
# #Deposition
# plot(dtm.change,
#      zlim = c(0, 10),
#      col = rainbow(5),
#      main = "Deposition Post-Flood \nBoulder, CO")

```

## Conclusions

We can see that high in the mountains, above Boulder, there is significant decreases in elevation corresponding to flood-induced landslides that lead to deposition along Boulder Creek and other waterways in Boulder.


* LiDAR DTMs show erosion and deposition patterns well
* Vegetation change however, is difficult to detect without further information
