# boulder_flood

This project is a collaboration between R. Paul and J. Atkins for the #NEONDI16 NEON Data Institute where we are examining differences between pre- and post-flood DTMs (digital terrain model) and DSMs (digital surface model) for the Boulder, CO region (2013). This analysis looks at changes in vegetation cover and in elevation (e.g. erosion).
